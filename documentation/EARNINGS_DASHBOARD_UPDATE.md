# Earnings Dashboard Update

## What Changed
Replaced the "Driver Application Trends" chart section with a comprehensive **Driver Earnings Dashboard** that provides actionable financial information for potential drivers.

## Why This Change
The application trends chart wasn't providing value to drivers making career decisions. The new dashboard gives them the critical information they need: **how much they can earn**.

## New Financial Dashboard Features

  - $2,500 sign-on bonus

- **Company Driver Card**
  - Annual range: $65K-$95K
  - $0.50-0.60 per mile
  - Weekly average: ~$1,538

### 2. **Visual Metrics Grid**
Each card includes 4 key metrics displayed prominently:

### 3. **Value Propositions**
Three additional cards highlighting:

- **Transparent Fees**: 0 hidden fees

### 4. **Direct CTAs**

## Impact
This change transforms a passive "social proof" chart into an active **decision-making tool** that directly addresses the #1 question drivers have: "How much will I make?"

The dashboard provides transparency and builds trust while also creating urgency by showing the substantial earning potential available.
