### **SCENE 1: HOOK (0:00-0:15)**
**Visual**: Quick cuts - truck on highway, driver in cab, dispatch center, founder speaking

**SPEAKER (Founder - Maninder Thind, or confident spokesperson):**
> "I spent 20 years behind the wheel. I know what it's like to be treated like a number. To see promises broken. To watch your settlement shrink with hidden fees you never agreed to."

**[PAUSE - Let that sink in]**

### **SCENE 2: THE PROBLEM (0:15-0:45)**
**Visual**: Split screen or quick cuts showing common driver frustrations

**SPEAKER:**
> "Most trucking companies promise you the world. Then you find out:
> 
> - You're keeping 65, 70, maybe 75% of what you earn
> - Fuel surcharge? They keep part of it
> - Forced dispatch on loads you don't want
> - Home time? 'We'll see' becomes 'maybe next month'
> - Equipment that's 10 years old and breaking down
> - Dispatch that doesn't answer the phone"

**Visual**: Show contrast - old truck vs. new 2024 Cascadia, empty dispatch center vs. active one

**Visual**: Founder speaking directly to camera, then cut to real drivers, trucks, operations

**SPEAKER:**
> "I started Thind Transport in 2016 with one truck. One simple idea: What if a trucking company actually kept its promises?
> 
> **91% commission** - not 70%, not 80%. Ninety-one percent. That's industry-leading, and it's not a gimmick.
> 
> **100% fuel surcharge pass-through** - every penny goes to you.
> 
> **No forced dispatch** - you choose your loads. You're the owner operator, you're in control.
> 
> **2024 Freightliner Cascadias** - modern, safe, comfortable equipment. Not hand-me-downs.
> 
> **24/7 dispatch** - real people who answer the phone. When you call, someone picks up.
> 
> **Weekly settlements** - transparent, accurate, on time. Every Friday. No surprises."

> 
> We've maintained an **A+ safety rating** since day one. We're FMCSA certified. We work with premier brokers - Amazon, Walmart, JB Hunt, C.H. Robinson.
> 
> But here's what matters most: We treat you like family, not a number."

> 
> If you're tired of broken promises, if you're ready to earn what you're worth, if you want to work with a company that respects you - let's talk."
