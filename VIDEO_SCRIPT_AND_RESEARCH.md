**Visual**: Bold text overlay "91% COMMISSION" or "$35K MORE PER YEAR" + truck on highway

**SPEAKER:**
> "You know what it's like. Being treated like a number. Promises broken. Watching your settlement shrink with hidden fees you never agreed to.

> 
> Here's how we're different:
> 
> **91% commission** - not 70%, not 80%. Ninety-one percent. That's industry-leading, and it's not a gimmick. Most companies keep 25-30%. We keep 9%.
> 
> **100% fuel surcharge pass-through** - every penny goes to you. Not 50%, not 75%. One hundred percent.
> 
> **No forced dispatch** - you choose your loads. You're the owner operator, you're in control. No one tells you what to haul.
> 
> **2024 Freightliner Cascadias** - modern, safe, comfortable equipment. Not 10-year-old hand-me-downs that break down.
> 
> **24/7 dispatch** - real people who answer the phone. When you call, someone picks up. Not a call center queue, not voicemail. A real person.
> 
> **Weekly settlements** - transparent, accurate, on time. Every Friday. No surprises, no hidden fees, no runaround."
